 <p>Agadir, on the southern Atlantic Coast, is Morocco's most famous beach resort town.

    European travelers looking for a laid-back and well-priced, family-friendly beach vacation have flocked here for decades. Agadir's trailing stretch of golden sand rims the length of the city center, so there's plenty of space to choose from.
    
    If you're after full facilities, with easy access to cafés and restaurants while on the sand, head to one of the two private sections known as Palm Beach and Sunset Beach. These two strips sit in front of Agadir's central tourism district and offer up the promise of easygoing days of sun and sand.

    <p>Sitting 129 kilometers south of Agadir, little Mirleft may not be as well-known as its northern neighbor, but for independent travelers who don't want a package-deal vacation, beach life at this southern Atlantic Coast town is better.

        There are several beaches to choose from, most backed by a rim of craggy rocks and cliffs. The wide sweep of Imin Tourga Beach is the central and most popular choice.
        
        Mirleft has a burgeoning activity scene, and most of the travelers who come here aren't after a beach holiday that's just about sun-soaked lounging.
        
        The main thing to do for visitors is learn to surf, with plenty of surf school operators offering five-day lesson packages, as well as equipment rental.
        
        There's also sea fishing and paragliding, and the town is a good base from which to launch yourself out to explore the tourist attractions of the Anti Atlas region inland.</p>
